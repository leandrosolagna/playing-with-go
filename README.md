# playing-with-go
A repository for me to play and learn GO.

## Mathfunctions module

I created this module with the intention of creating formulas from math or calculus.

Thought this could be the best way for me to start playing around to understand Go. In this module I will try to not use many packages offered by Go and develop my own logic.

**Be aware**, that everything is not perfect. So if you decide to use it, do it with caution.

### Bhaskara formula

I created 3 functions to be able to calculate both values of root.

 - 1 function to get the value of delta
 - 1 funcion to get root value
 - 1 function to calculate x1 and x2

## Issues

Issues are welcomed. I will try my best to fix any.
